By promoting active listening and empathy, construction professionals can foster a supportive and non-threatening atmosphere during conflict resolution.

## 5\. Ensuring Follow-Up and Support

After conflict resolution, it is essential to ensure follow-up and ongoing support for all parties involved. Techniques include:

- Reviewing agreements and decisions: Confirming that agreed-upon resolutions are documented, understood, and implemented.
